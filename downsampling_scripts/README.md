# README for downsampling scripts

There are a lot of very similar files in this directory. Usually, I try to make general scripts so that they can be recycled for nearly identical scripts. The script [filter_snps_and_make_wide_format.R](filter_snps_and_make_wide_format.R) is a good example of this. In the case of downsampling, I used different subdirectories for some of the analyses so the only difference might be the path to the working directory. The input files might also differ slightly. For example, in [filter_with_vcftools_2fold.sh](filter_with_vcftools_2fold.sh) (as well as the 4-fold and 8-fold versions), the input file name [vcf_list_new_2fold.txt](vcf_list_new_2fold.txt) was just called ```vcf_list_new.txt``` in the directory, but has been renamed here so they won't conflict with each other.

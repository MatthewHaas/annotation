## Annotation of the Zizania palustris genome


## karyotpe.py
This script was originally written by Haibao Tang (https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi). I am including the script here because I modified it in order to create my plots. Line 40 was altered so that **arg[5]** (the name we assign to each track in the layout file) is printed in italics. Line 239 was also changed (dividing vpad by 2 was removed) to make extra room on the margin so that _Zizania palustris_ could be fully written out (versus abbreviating it as _Z. palustris_--which also didn't fit initally--it ran into the representations of the chromosomes.
